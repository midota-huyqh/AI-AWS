> **Note:** This post explores how to streamline inference workflows using Amazon Nova foundation models via Amazon Bedrock. No confidential data is shared.

## Introduction

Amazon Nova is a next-generation family of foundation models offering industry-leading performance and cost-efficiency through Amazon Bedrock. These models natively support text, image, video, and speech workflows, and can be customized via fine-tuning or distillation to meet specific application needs.

## Model Overview

| Model           | Modality          | Latency           | Cost Level | Ideal Use Cases                      |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Nova Micro**  | Text only         | Ultra low (<50ms) | $          | High-volume chat and text workloads  |
| **Nova Lite**   | Multimodal        | Low (<200ms)      | $          | Quick image, video, and text analysis|
| **Nova Pro**    | Multimodal        | Moderate (<500ms) | $$         | Complex reasoning and generation     |
| **Nova Canvas** | Image generation  | Moderate (<800ms) | $$         | Professional-grade visuals           |
| **Nova Reel**   | Video generation  | Higher (<1s)      | $$         | Short video and marketing clips      |
| **Nova Sonic**  | Speech-to-Speech  | Real-time         | $$         | Voice assistants and podcasts        |

## Use Case: Enhancing Performance & Scalability

We centralized our AI inference through a single Bedrock endpoint to serve both internal microservices and public-facing apps. Key outcomes:

- **50% Lower Latency:** Chat queries via Nova Micro now return sub-100â€¯ms first tokens.
- **40% Cost Savings:** Routine image and text tasks on Nova Lite reduced expenses by two-fifths.
- **65% Cost Efficiency:** Document summarization and code generation using Nova Pro outperform alternatives by a significant margin.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Prototype with Nova Micro, then shift to Nova Pro for production workloads requiring higher accuracy.

## Real-World Example

A customer support chatbot processes 10,000 daily inquiries. By moving from a generic LLM to **Nova Micro**, average response time dropped from 1.2â€¯s to 0.15â€¯s, boosting customer satisfaction scores by 20% while cutting inference costs by 45%.

## Integration & Customization

1. **Bedrock Converse API:** Invoke models by ID directly within your application code.
2. **Fine-Tuning:** Prepare a JSONL dataset of domain-specific Q&A pairs and run Bedrockâ€™s fine-tuning job.
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Connect Nova Pro to your knowledge base for up-to-date, fact-backed responses.
4. **Multimodal Pipelines:** Chain Nova Liteâ€™s image OCR output into Nova Pro for downstream summarization.

```python
import boto3
import json

client = boto3.client('bedrock')

def chat(query):
    response = client.invoke_model(
        modelId='amazon-nova-micro',
        contentType='application/json',
        body=json.dumps({'inputText': query})
    )
    return response['body']

print(chat('What is the status of order #1234?'))
